==========
Edit PATH environment on Windows conveniently

The default environment editor is not great at editing PATH if there are lot of entries and many of them are similar looking.
* Implemented using Win32, **Does not depend on MFC or .NET**
* Missing folders are highlighted with different icon.
* To edit System PATH, offers to be launched with elevated admin privilege, similar to "Run as Administrator"
* Double clicking any path entry attempts to open in Windows Explorer.
